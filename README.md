## What is Decentralized Finance?

## What to do if I have an idea, but no money and connections with VCs
Following the [Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/principles) methodology, you don't have to have money to validate your hypothesis, but even though to build an MVP it wouldn't be superfluous to have some intital capital.

**BUT what if:**

- you don't know how to fundraise, you don't have money to start a project, and you don't have any connections with VCs
- you want to validate your idea directly through the market and not waiting for 1-2 years by building something, more likely, useless
- you don't want polishing your pitch deck at the early stage, but focus on your product

Well, good news, there are few ways how you can start realizing your idea easily

### 1. Hackathons

One of the best way to find a team, make friends, build an MVP, and get early feedback

- [ETHGlobal](https://www.ethglobal.co/#) is the main event series of hackathons in Ethereum ecosystem being held all around the globe

### 2. Venture DAO

New type of crowdfunding, community-driven VCs

- [MetaCartel Ventures](https://metacartel.xyz/) is a community run investment DAO, looking to invest in Ethereum DApps. They have top mentors on the DeFi market.

- [The LAO](https://www.thelao.io/) is for-profit, legal liability autonomous organization


### 3. Grants

- [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/grants/) provides a novel  way of funding open source projects for public benefit with [Quadratic Funding](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3243656) matching contributions from Gitcoin's fund sponsored by donors in the Ethereum ecosystem and community

- [Moloch DAO](https://www.molochdao.com/) is a community funding initiative focused on Ethereum ecosystem development

- [MetaCartel](https://www.metacartel.org/) is helping early teams get to the next level with grant funding and operational support

- [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org/foundation/) is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting Ethereum and related technologies.

- [ConsenSys Grants](https://consensys.net/grants/) are also focused on Ethereum ecosystem accelerating 
- Project specific grants: [MakerDAO](https://community-development.makerdao.com/grants), [Aragon](https://github.com/aragon/nest), [Aave](https://medium.com/aave/aave-ecosystem-grants-88260ede1485)
